We will preform an analysis on a data set gathered from "The Australian Food
Composition Database" using several machine learning techniques and algorithms.

There are many problems we could tackle with this data set however this report will focus on
predicting the ’Energy (KJ)’ per 100g of a food is based off its nutrient composition. This
choice was based off this being a real and interesting problem that is worth investigating.
Currently the true energy content of a food is calculated through a very complicated and
potentially costly process. Thus, being able to estimate the energy content of a food based
off a small amount of nutritional information is a potentially very useful technique. However
these techniques could be applied to different target variables to achieve similar analysis.
